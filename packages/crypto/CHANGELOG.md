# @motebit/crypto Changelog

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 009f56e: Add cryptosuite discriminator to every signed wire-format artifact.

  `@motebit/protocol` now exports `SuiteId`, `SuiteEntry`, `SuiteStatus`,
  `SuiteAlgorithm`, `SuiteCanonicalization`, `SuiteSignatureEncoding`,
  `SuitePublicKeyEncoding`, `SUITE_REGISTRY`, `ALL_SUITE_IDS`, `isSuiteId`,
  `getSuiteEntry`. Every signed artifact type gains a required `suite:
SuiteId` field alongside `signature`. Four Ed25519 suites enumerated
  (`motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1`, `motebit-jcs-ed25519-hex-v1`,
  `motebit-jwt-ed25519-v1`, `motebit-concat-ed25519-hex-v1`) plus the
  existing W3C `eddsa-jcs-2022` for Verifiable Credentials.

  Verifiers reject missing or unknown `suite` values fail-closed. No
  legacy compatibility path. Signers emit `suite` on every new artifact.

  Identity file signature format changed:
  - Old: `<!-- motebit:sig:Ed25519:{hex} -->`
  - New: `<!-- motebit:sig:motebit-jcs-ed25519-hex-v1:{hex} -->`

  The `identity.algorithm` frontmatter field is deprecated (ignored with
  a warning when present; no longer emitted on export).

  Post-quantum migration becomes a new `SuiteId` entry + dispatch arm in
  `@motebit/crypto/suite-dispatch.ts`, not a wire-format change.

  ## Migration

  This release is breaking for every consumer that constructs, signs, or verifies a motebit signed artifact. The change is mechanical — add one field on construction, pass one argument on sign, re-sign identity files once — but there is no legacy acceptance path, so every caller must update in lockstep. Verifiers reject unsuited or unknown-suite artifacts fail-closed. Migration steps follow, grouped by the consumer surface.

  ### For consumers of `@motebit/protocol` types

  Every signed-artifact type now has a required `suite: SuiteId` field.
  Anywhere you construct one (tests, mocks, fixtures), add the correct
  suite value for that artifact class — see `SUITE_REGISTRY`'s
  `description` field for the per-artifact assignment, or consult
  `spec/<artifact>-v1.md §N.N` for the binding wire format.

  ```ts
  // Before
  const receipt: ExecutionReceipt = {
    task_id, motebit_id, ...,
    signature: sigHex,
  };

  // After
  import type { SuiteId } from "@motebit/protocol";
  const receipt: ExecutionReceipt = {
    task_id, motebit_id, ...,
    suite: "motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1" satisfies SuiteId,
    signature: sigHex,
  };
  ```

  ### For consumers of `@motebit/crypto` sign/verify helpers

  Sign helpers that previously accepted just keys now require a `suite`
  parameter constrained to the suites valid for the artifact class:

  ```ts
  // Before
  const receipt = await signExecutionReceipt(body, privateKey);

  // After
  const receipt = await signExecutionReceipt(body, privateKey, {
    suite: "motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1",
  });
  ```

  Verify helpers route through the internal `verifyBySuite` dispatcher;
  direct calls are unchanged at the boundary, but behavior now rejects
  artifacts without a `suite` field (legacy-no-suite path is deleted).

  ### For consumers of `motebit.md` identity files

  Identity files signed before this release will fail to parse. Re-sign
  by running `motebit export --regenerate` (or the CLI equivalent) after
  upgrading. The `identity.algorithm` YAML field is ignored on new
  parses and no longer emitted on export.

  ### For consumers of `DelegationToken` (`@motebit/crypto`)

  `DelegationToken` carries two breaking changes beyond the suite addition.
  Public keys are now **hex-encoded** (64 chars, lowercase) instead of
  base64url — consistent with every other Ed25519-key-carrying motebit
  artifact. And `signDelegation` takes `Omit<DelegationToken, "signature"
| "suite">` (the signer stamps the suite).

  ```ts
  // Before
  const token = await signDelegation(
    {
      delegator_id,
      delegator_public_key: toBase64Url(kp.publicKey),
      delegate_id,
      delegate_public_key: toBase64Url(otherKp.publicKey),
      scope,
      issued_at,
      expires_at,
    },
    kp.privateKey,
  );

  // After
  const token = await signDelegation(
    {
      delegator_id,
      delegator_public_key: bytesToHex(kp.publicKey),
      delegate_id,
      delegate_public_key: bytesToHex(otherKp.publicKey),
      scope,
      issued_at,
      expires_at,
    },
    kp.privateKey,
  );
  // token.suite is stamped as "motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1"
  ```

  Verifiers reject tokens without `suite` (or with any value other than
  `"motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1"`) fail-closed, and decode `delegator_public_key`
  from hex. Base64url-encoded tokens issued before this release do not
  verify — pre-launch, no migration tool is provided; re-issue tokens
  after upgrading.

  ### Running the new drift gates locally

  `pnpm run check` now runs ten drift gates (previously eight). Two new
  gates — `check-suite-declared` and `check-suite-dispatch` — enforce
  that every signed Wire-format spec section names a `suite` field and
  that every verifier in `@motebit/crypto` dispatches via the shared
  `verifyBySuite` function (no direct primitive calls).

- 2d8b91a: **Permissive floor flipped from MIT to Apache-2.0. Every contributor's work on the floor now carries an explicit, irrevocable patent grant and a patent-litigation-termination clause.**

  The `@motebit/protocol`, `@motebit/sdk`, `@motebit/crypto`, `@motebit/verifier`, `create-motebit`, the four `@motebit/crypto-*` hardware-attestation platform leaves (Apple App Attest, Google Play Integrity, TPM 2.0, WebAuthn), and the `motebit-verify` GitHub Action — the permissive-floor packages — have moved from MIT to Apache-2.0 in a coordinated release. The `spec/` tree carries Apache-2.0 too; every committed JSON Schema artifact under `spec/schemas/*.json` carries `"$comment": "SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0"` as its first field.

  ## Why
  1. **Patent clarity across the floor.** The floor now includes four verifiers operating against vendor attestation chains in heavy patent territory — Apple, Google, Microsoft, Infineon, Nuvoton, STMicroelectronics, Intel, Yubico, the FIDO Alliance. The VC/DID space the protocol builds on also carries patent filings. Apache-2.0 §3 grants every contributor's patent license irrevocably; §4.2 terminates the license of anyone who litigates patent claims against the Work. MIT is silent on patents.
  2. **Convergence.** The BSL runtime converts to Apache-2.0 at the Change Date (four years after each version's first public release). With the floor at MIT, the end state was MIT floor + Apache-2.0 runtime — two licenses forever. With the floor at Apache-2.0, the end state is one license: one posture, one patent grant, one procurement decision. Motebit's meta-principle is "never let spec and code diverge"; a built-in two-license end state is exactly the drift the rest of the codebase is designed to prevent.
  3. **Enterprise and standards-track posture.** Identity infrastructure that serious operators bet on ships Apache-2.0: Kubernetes, Kafka, Envoy, Istio, OpenTelemetry, SPIFFE, Keycloak. The IETF and W3C working groups that may eventually carry motebit specs also ship reference implementations under Apache-2.0. The license is part of the signal that motebit is protocol infrastructure, not an npm utility library.

  ## What changed at npm
  - `@motebit/protocol` `license` field: `"MIT"` → `"Apache-2.0"`.
  - `@motebit/sdk` `license` field: `"MIT"` → `"Apache-2.0"`.
  - `@motebit/crypto` `license` field: `"MIT"` → `"Apache-2.0"`.
  - `@motebit/verifier` `license` field: `"MIT"` → `"Apache-2.0"`.
  - `create-motebit` `license` field: `"MIT"` → `"Apache-2.0"`.
  - Each package's `LICENSE` file is replaced with the canonical Apache-2.0 text plus the existing trademark-reservation paragraph.
  - The `@motebit/crypto-appattest`, `@motebit/crypto-play-integrity`, `@motebit/crypto-tpm`, `@motebit/crypto-webauthn` leaves (currently private, bundled into `@motebit/verify`) also flip to Apache-2.0 at the source level.
  - A new `NOTICE` file at the repository root names the project, copyright holder, and trademark reservation per Apache §4.
  - The orphaned root `LICENSE-MIT` file is removed; the protocol badge and doctrine now point at `LICENSING.md` and the per-package `LICENSE` files.
  - `spec/` LICENSE is rewritten to Apache-2.0; the 52 committed JSON Schema artifacts under `spec/schemas/*.json` carry the `Apache-2.0` SPDX stamp.

  ## Migration

  For downstream consumers of the floor packages: **no code change required**. Apache-2.0 is strictly broader than MIT — everything permitted under MIT remains permitted under Apache-2.0. The `license` field in the npm manifest changes value, the installed `LICENSE` text changes shape, and the published `NOTICE` file appears, but nothing about importing or calling these packages changes.

  ```diff
    // Before — consumer's package.json
    "dependencies": {
  -   "@motebit/protocol": "^0.8.0"   // MIT
  +   "@motebit/protocol": "^1.0.0"   // Apache-2.0
    }
  ```

  ```ts
  // Before and after — no code change; same imports, same behavior
  import type { ExecutionReceipt } from "@motebit/protocol";
  import { verify, signExecutionReceipt } from "@motebit/crypto";
  ```

  For downstream contributors: the contributions you submit to the permissive floor now carry an explicit Apache §3 patent grant and are covered by the §4.2 litigation-termination clause. Inbound = outbound: what you grant to the project is what the project grants to users. The signed CLA (`CLA.md`) is updated in the same commit to reflect the new license instance. No re-signing is required for contributors who have already signed; the inbound-equals-outbound principle does the right thing automatically.

  For operators: the root `LICENSE` BSL text is unchanged. The embedded "Apache-2.0-Licensed Components" section lists the ten permissive-floor packages and `spec/`. A new `NOTICE` file at the repo root carries the Apache §4 attribution. The orphan `LICENSE-MIT` file at the repo root is removed.

  ## Backwards compatibility

  Apache-2.0 is broader than MIT — everything permitted under MIT remains permitted under Apache-2.0. Existing consumers of the floor packages do not need to change anything to continue use. The new additions are the patent grant (you, as a contributor, pass one) and the termination clause (you, as a contributor, lose your license if you sue over patents).

  ## Naming

  Identifier-level code (`PERMISSIVE_PACKAGES`, `PERMISSIVE_IMPORT_ALLOWED`, `PERMISSIVE_ALLOWED_FUNCTIONS`, the `check-spec-permissive-boundary` CI gate, the `permissive-client-only-e2e.test.ts` adversarial test) uses the architectural role name — "permissive floor" — not the specific license instance. Same pattern the codebase already uses for cryptosuite agility (one `SuiteId` registry; specific instances like `motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1` are replaceable). Doctrine prose names `Apache-2.0` concretely where instance-level precision matters.

- e17bf47: Publish the four hardware-attestation platform verifier leaves as first-class
  Apache-2.0 packages, joining the fixed-group release at 1.0.0.

  Stop-ship finding from the 1.0 pre-publish audit: `@motebit/verify@1.0.0`
  declared runtime dependencies on four `@motebit/crypto-*` adapters marked
  `"private": true`, which would have caused `npm install @motebit/verify` to
  404 on the adapters. The root `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `LICENSING.md`, and the
  hardware-attestation doctrine all claim these adapters as public Apache-2.0
  permissive-floor packages — the `"private": true` markers were doctrine drift
  left behind from scaffolding.

  This changeset closes the drift by publishing the adapters and wiring them
  into the fixed group so they bump in lockstep with the rest of the protocol
  surface:
  - `@motebit/crypto-appattest` — Apple App Attest chain verifier (pinned
    Apple root)
  - `@motebit/crypto-play-integrity` — Google Play Integrity JWT verifier
    (pinned Google JWKS; structurally complete, fail-closed by default pending
    operator key wiring)
  - `@motebit/crypto-tpm` — TPM 2.0 Endorsement-Key chain verifier (pinned
    vendor roots)
  - `@motebit/crypto-webauthn` — WebAuthn packed-attestation verifier (pinned
    FIDO roots)

  Each carries the standard permissive-floor manifest (description, `exports`,
  `files`, `sideEffects: false`, `NOTICE`, keywords, homepage/repository/bugs,
  `publishConfig: public`, `lint:pack` with `publint` + `attw`, focused README
  showing how to wire the verifier into `@motebit/crypto`'s
  `HardwareAttestationVerifiers` dispatcher).

  Also in this changeset:
  - `engines.node` aligned to `>=20` across `@motebit/protocol`, `@motebit/sdk`,
    and `@motebit/crypto` — matches the rest of the fixed group and removes
    downstream consumer confusion (a `@motebit/verify` consumer on Node 18
    previously got inconsistent engines-check signals between libraries).
  - `NOTICE` added to `motebit` (the bundled CLI's tarball, required by Apache
    §4(d) because the bundle inlines Apache-licensed code from the permissive
    floor).

  No code changes — all four adapter implementations and public APIs are
  unchanged. The flip is manifest + metadata + README + fixed-group wiring.

  ## Migration

  **For `@motebit/verify` consumers:** no action required. `npm install -g @motebit/verify@1.0.0` now correctly pulls the four platform adapter packages from npm instead of failing on unpublished `workspace:*` refs. Before this changeset, `npm install @motebit/verify@1.0.0` would have 404'd on `@motebit/crypto-appattest@1.0.0` et al.

  **For direct library consumers (new capability):** the four platform adapters can now be imported independently when a third party wants only one platform's verifier without pulling the full CLI. Wiring into `@motebit/crypto`'s dispatcher:

  ```ts
  // Before (1.0.0-rc and earlier — adapters not installable from npm):
  // only possible via @motebit/verify's bundled verifyFile():
  import { verifyFile } from "@motebit/verifier";
  import { buildHardwareVerifiers } from "@motebit/verify";
  const result = await verifyFile("cred.json", {
    hardwareAttestation: buildHardwareVerifiers(),
  });

  // After (1.0.0 — fine-grained composition):
  import { verify } from "@motebit/crypto";
  import { deviceCheckVerifier } from "@motebit/crypto-appattest";
  import { webauthnVerifier } from "@motebit/crypto-webauthn";

  const result = await verify(credential, {
    hardwareAttestation: {
      deviceCheck: deviceCheckVerifier({ expectedBundleId: "com.example.app" }),
      webauthn: webauthnVerifier({ expectedRpId: "example.com" }),
      // tpm / playIntegrity omitted — verifier returns `adapter-not-configured` for those platforms
    },
  });
  ```

  **For Node 18 consumers of `@motebit/protocol`, `@motebit/sdk`, or `@motebit/crypto`:** the `engines.node` field now declares `>=20` across the entire fixed group (previously drifted: protocol/sdk/crypto said `>=18`, other packages said `>=20`). npm does not hard-enforce `engines` by default, so installs continue to succeed — but teams running strict-engine linters should upgrade to Node 20 LTS. Node 18 entered maintenance-only status April 2025.

  **For third-party protocol implementers:** no wire-format changes. The four platform attestation wire formats (`AppAttestCbor`, Play Integrity JWT, `TPMS_ATTEST`, WebAuthn packed attestation) are unchanged — this changeset only publishes the reference TypeScript verifiers for each.

- 58c6d99: **@motebit/verify resurrected as the canonical CLI, three-package lineage locked in.**

  The entire published protocol surface bumps to 1.0.0 in a coordinated release. What changes at npm:
  - **`@motebit/verify@1.0.0`** — fresh lineage superseding the deprecated `0.7.0` zero-dep library. Ships the `motebit-verify` CLI binary with every hardware-attestation platform bundled (Apple App Attest, Google Play Integrity, TPM 2.0, WebAuthn) and motebit-canonical defaults pre-wired (bundle IDs, RP ID, integrity floor). Network-free, self-attesting. License: Apache-2.0 — the aggregator encodes no motebit-proprietary judgment (defaults are overridable flags, not trust scoring or economics), so it sits on the permissive floor alongside the underlying leaves. Runs `npm install -g @motebit/verify` to get the tool, no license friction in CI pipelines or enterprise audit tooling.
  - **`@motebit/verifier@1.0.0`** — library-only. The `motebit-verify` CLI that used to live here has moved to `@motebit/verify` (above). This package now ships only the Apache-2.0 helpers (`verifyFile`, `verifyArtifact`, `formatHuman`, `VerifyFileOptions` with the optional `hardwareAttestation` injection point). Third parties writing Apache-2.0-only TypeScript verifiers compose this with `@motebit/crypto` — and optionally any subset of the four Apache-2.0 `@motebit/crypto-*` platform leaves — without pulling BSL code.
  - **`@motebit/crypto@1.0.0`** — role unchanged; version bump marks 1.0 maturity of the primitive substrate. Apache-2.0 (upgraded from MIT in the same release; the floor flip gives every contributor's work an explicit patent grant and litigation-termination clause), zero monorepo deps.
  - **`@motebit/protocol@1.0.0`** — wire types + algebra. Apache-2.0 permissive floor. 1.0 signals the protocol surface is stable enough to implement against.
  - **`@motebit/sdk@1.0.0`** — stable developer-contract surface. 1.0 locks the provider-resolver / preset / config vocabulary for integrators.
  - **`create-motebit@1.0.0`** — scaffolder bumps to match.
  - **`motebit@1.0.0`** — operator console CLI bumps to match.

  The three-package lineage for verification tooling follows the pattern that survives decades — git / libgit2, cargo / tokio, npm / @npm/arborist:

  ```
  @motebit/verify                Apache-2.0  the CLI motebit-verify + motebit-canonical defaults over the bundled leaves
  @motebit/verifier              Apache-2.0  library: verifyFile, verifyArtifact, formatHuman
  @motebit/crypto                Apache-2.0  primitives: verify, sign, suite dispatch
  @motebit/crypto-appattest      Apache-2.0  Apple App Attest chain verifier (pinned Apple root)
  @motebit/crypto-play-integrity Apache-2.0  Google Play Integrity JWT verifier (pinned Google JWKS)
  @motebit/crypto-tpm            Apache-2.0  TPM 2.0 EK chain verifier (pinned vendor roots)
  @motebit/crypto-webauthn       Apache-2.0  WebAuthn packed-attestation verifier (pinned FIDO roots)
  ```

  All seven packages in the verification lineage ship Apache-2.0 — the full verification surface lives on the permissive floor. Each answers "how is this artifact verified?" against a published public trust anchor, the permissive side of the protocol-model boundary test. The BSL line holds at `motebit` (the operator console) and everything below it, where the actual reference-implementation judgment lives (daemon, MCP server, delegation routing, market integration, federation wiring). See the separate `permissive-floor-apache-2-0` and `verify-cli-apache-2-0` changesets for the rationale behind the floor licensing.

  ## Migration

  The 1.0 release is a coordinated major bump across the fixed release group. The APIs exported by `@motebit/protocol`, `@motebit/sdk`, `@motebit/crypto`, `create-motebit`, and `motebit` have NOT broken — this major marks endgame-pattern maturity, not a code-shape change. The actual behavioral shifts are confined to the verification-tooling lineage:

  **1. `@motebit/verifier` bin removed (breaking).**

  ```ts
  // Before — @motebit/verifier@0.8.x shipped a `motebit-verify` binary.
  // After  — @motebit/verifier@1.0.0 is library-only.
  // Install `@motebit/verify@^1.0.0` for the CLI:
  //   npm install -g @motebit/verify
  //   motebit-verify cred.json
  // The programmatic library surface is unchanged:
  import { verifyFile, formatHuman } from "@motebit/verifier"; // ← still works
  ```

  **2. `@motebit/verify@0.7.0` (deprecated library) → `@motebit/verify@1.0.0` (resurrected CLI).**

  | You were using (0.7.0)                               | Migrate to                                                                          |
  | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `verify()` function in TypeScript                    | `import { verify } from "@motebit/crypto"` — same shape, more features              |
  | `verifyFile` / `formatHuman` / programmatic wrappers | `import { verifyFile } from "@motebit/verifier"`                                    |
  | Running `motebit-verify` on the command line         | `npm install -g @motebit/verify` at `^1.0.0` — same command, full platform coverage |

  Users pinned to `"@motebit/verify": "^0.7.0"` stay on the deprecated 0.x line automatically — semver prevents auto-bumps to 1.0.0. The 0.x tarballs remain immutable on npm; archaeology is preserved.

  ## Rationale

  The entire published protocol surface hits 1.0 together as the endgame-pattern milestone. The three-package lineage for verification tooling (verify / verifier / crypto) follows the shape long-lived tool families use — git / libgit2, cargo / tokio, npm / @npm/arborist. The coordinated major signals that this is the architecture intended to hold long-term.

  **Operator follow-up — run immediately after `pnpm changeset publish` returns:**

  ```bash
  npm deprecate @motebit/verify@0.7.0 \
    "Superseded by @motebit/verify@1.x — the canonical CLI. For the library, see @motebit/crypto."
  ```

  The current deprecation message on `0.7.0` dates from the 2026-04-09 package rename and still claims "Same MIT license" — factually correct then, stale the moment 1.0.0 ships (the permissive floor is now Apache-2.0). The replacement message points at both migration paths — the CLI (`@motebit/verify@1.x`) and the library (`@motebit/crypto`) — and makes no license claim that can age. Running it immediately after publish keeps the stale-message window down to minutes, not days.

### Minor Changes

- 1690469: Wire `BalanceWaiver` producer + verifier (spec/migration-v1.md §7.2). `@motebit/crypto` adds `signBalanceWaiver` / `verifyBalanceWaiver` / `BALANCE_WAIVER_SUITE` alongside the existing artifact signers; `@motebit/encryption` re-exports them so apps stay on the product-vocabulary surface. `@motebit/virtual-accounts` gains a `"waiver"` `TransactionType` so the debit carries a dedicated audit-trail category. The relay's `/migrate/depart` route now accepts an optional `balance_waiver` body — balance > 0 requires either a confirmed withdrawal (prior behavior) or a valid signed waiver for at least the current balance; the persisted waiver JSON is stored verbatim on the migration row for auditor reverification. The `motebit migrate` CLI gains a `--waive` flag that signs the waiver with the identity key and attaches it to the depart call, with a destructive-action confirmation prompt. Closes the one-pass-delivery gap left over from commit `7afce18c` (wire artifact without consumers).
- 25b14fc: Close dispute-v1 §6.5 foundation-law gap: "A relay must not self-adjudicate when it is the defendant." `@motebit/crypto` adds `signAdjudicatorVote` / `verifyAdjudicatorVote` / `ADJUDICATOR_VOTE_SUITE` and `signDisputeResolution` / `verifyDisputeResolution` / `DISPUTE_RESOLUTION_SUITE` alongside the other artifact signers. The vote signature binds `dispute_id` (spec §6.5 replay-prevention invariant — votes from one dispute cannot be stuffed into another). The resolution verifier re-checks every embedded vote signature when the federation path is populated — aggregated-only verdicts are rejected. `@motebit/encryption` re-exports.

  The relay's `/resolve` route now refuses to self-adjudicate when the relay is the filer or respondent (409 with §6.3/§6.5 pointer) and routes signing through `signDisputeResolution` instead of constructing canonical JSON inline. Leader-side federation orchestration (peer enumeration, vote collection, aggregation, timeout handling) is deferred until the first federation peer peers in production — the primitives are now in place so the orchestrator has no plumbing lag when it lands.

- 3539756: Add `signDisputeRequest` / `verifyDisputeRequest`, `signDisputeEvidence` /
  `verifyDisputeEvidence`, and `signDisputeAppeal` / `verifyDisputeAppeal`
  primitives to `@motebit/crypto` (re-exported through `@motebit/encryption`).

  Each follows the `signAdjudicatorVote` / `signDisputeResolution` shape:
  the signer owns `signature` and `suite`; the verifier fail-closes on
  unknown suite, base64url decode error, and primitive verification
  failure. The associated suite constants (`DISPUTE_REQUEST_SUITE`,
  `DISPUTE_EVIDENCE_SUITE`, `DISPUTE_APPEAL_SUITE`) are added alongside
  and currently equal `motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1`.

  Motivation: the relay now enforces spec/dispute-v1.md §4.2 + §5.2 + §8.2
  foundation law that every dispute artifact MUST be signed by its
  authoring party. Previously these were inline `c.req.json<{…}>()`
  construction inputs at `services/api/src/disputes.ts`; without the
  signature binding the relay could not verify foundation law §4.4
  ("filing party must be a direct party to the task"). Third parties
  implementing motebit/dispute@1.0 now have the canonical sign + verify
  recipes available in Apache-2.0-licensed `@motebit/crypto` with zero monorepo
  dependencies.

  ### Migration

  ```ts
  import { signDisputeRequest } from "@motebit/encryption"; // or @motebit/crypto

  const signed = await signDisputeRequest(
    {
      dispute_id: "dsp-uuid-v7",
      task_id,
      allocation_id,
      filed_by,
      respondent,
      category,
      description,
      evidence_refs,
      filed_at,
    },
    filerPrivateKey,
  );
  // POST signed → /api/v1/allocations/:allocationId/dispute
  ```

- 28c46dd: `getPublicKeyBySuite(privateKey, suite)` — new permissive-floor (Apache-2.0) primitive for suite-dispatched public-key derivation. Closes a real protocol-primitive-blindness violation in the CLI and plugs the regex hole that let it slip past `check-suite-dispatch`.

  A surface-parity audit on 2026-04-18 found that `apps/cli/src/subcommands/delegate.ts` was calling `ed.getPublicKeyAsync(privateKey)` directly via dynamic import — protocol-primitive-blindness as defined in `feedback_protocol_primitive_blindness.md` and the `@motebit/crypto/CLAUDE.md` Rule 1 ("`src/suite-dispatch.ts` is the ONLY file permitted to call `@noble/ed25519` primitives directly"). The violation slipped past `check-suite-dispatch` because its FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS regex `/\bed\.getPublicKey\b/` does not match `ed.getPublicKeyAsync` — `\b` requires a word/non-word transition, and `K` followed by `A` (both word chars) is not a boundary.

  This pass:
  - **`getPublicKeyBySuite(privateKey: Uint8Array, suite: SuiteId): Promise<Uint8Array>`** added to `packages/crypto/src/suite-dispatch.ts`. Sibling to `verifyBySuite` / `signBySuite` / `generateEd25519Keypair` — same exhaustive switch on the `SuiteId` literal union so the TypeScript compiler refuses to compile when ML-DSA / SLH-DSA suites land without an explicit arm. Re-exported through `signing.ts` so it surfaces from `@motebit/crypto`.
  - **Permissive export allowlist updated.** `getPublicKeyBySuite` added to `PERMISSIVE_ALLOWED_FUNCTIONS["@motebit/crypto"]` in `scripts/check-deps.ts`.
  - **CLI delegate path routed through the dispatcher.** `apps/cli/src/subcommands/delegate.ts` now imports `getPublicKeyBySuite` from `@motebit/crypto` instead of dynamically importing `@noble/ed25519`. PQ-ready by construction — when ML-DSA suites land, only the dispatcher arm changes. `apps/cli/package.json` declares `@motebit/crypto` directly (was previously consumed only transitively through `@motebit/runtime`).
  - **Regex hole patched.** `scripts/check-suite-dispatch.ts` adds `\bed\.getPublicKeyAsync\b` to FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS and tightens the existing `\bed\.getPublicKey\b` to `\b...\b(?!Async)` matching the established convention used by `verify` / `sign` (every primitive name has both a sync rule and an explicit Async rule). The next time anyone tries to call `ed.getPublicKeyAsync` outside the dispatcher, CI fails immediately.

  The Ring 1 doctrine ("capability, not form") is unchanged — surfaces correctly continue to consume crypto through `@motebit/encryption` (which re-exports from `@motebit/crypto`) where appropriate. Adding `check-surface-primitives` to mandate dep declarations was considered and rejected: the existing `check-suite-dispatch` already covers the real failure mode (direct `@noble` calls); the dep-declaration question is style, not architecture.

- f69d3fb: Add `./suite-dispatch` subpath export. Edge-neutral bundle exposing `verifyBySuite`, `signBySuite`, `ed25519Sign`, `ed25519Verify`, `generateEd25519Keypair`, and `getPublicKeyBySuite` without the YAML / did:key / credential / credential-anchor surface of the main entry — for Vercel Edge, Workers, and other runtimes where the full package exceeds the bundle budget. Closes the `services/proxy/src/validation.ts` `ed.verifyAsync` waiver; the proxy now routes through `verifyBySuite`.
- 3747b7a: Sign SettlementRecord — protocol-layer support. Closes audit
  finding #1 from the cross-plane review.

  `services/api/CLAUDE.md` rule 6 states: "Every truth the relay
  asserts (credential anchor proofs, revocation memos, settlement
  receipts) is independently verifiable onchain without relay
  contact." Federation settlements deliver this through Merkle
  batching + onchain anchoring (relay-federation-v1.md §7.6). **Per-
  agent settlements did not** — the wire format was unsigned, so a
  relay could issue inconsistent records to different observers (e.g.
  show the worker `{amount_settled: 95, fee: 5}` and an auditor
  `{amount_settled: 80, fee: 20}`) and both would "validate" because
  no signature committed the relay to either claim.

  This commit adds the protocol-layer self-attestation primitive:
  - `SettlementRecord` gains `issuer_relay_id` + `suite` + `signature`
    fields (`@motebit/protocol`)
  - `signSettlement(record, issuerPrivateKey)` and
    `verifySettlement(record, issuerPublicKey)` shipped in
    `@motebit/crypto`, re-exported from `@motebit/encryption`
  - `@motebit/wire-schemas` SettlementRecord flips back to `.strict()`
    with the three new required fields; `additionalProperties: false`
    in the published JSON Schema
  - Spec `delegation-v1.md` §6.3 wire-format table updated; §6.4
    foundation law adds: "Every emitted SettlementRecord MUST be
    signed by its issuer_relay_id. The signature covers the entire
    record except `signature` itself, including `amount_settled`,
    `platform_fee`, and `platform_fee_rate` — committing the relay
    to the exact values it published. A relay that issues
    inconsistent records to different observers fails self-
    attestation: at most one of the records verifies."

  Crypto-layer round-trip + tampering tests added: amount tampering,
  fee_rate tampering, wrong-key, unknown-suite all reject as
  expected. Determinism (same input → same signature) verified.

  ## Migration

  `SettlementRecord.issuer_relay_id`, `suite`, and `signature` are
  now required fields in the wire format. Any consumer constructing
  a `SettlementRecord` literal must add them:

  ```diff
   const record: SettlementRecord = {
     settlement_id: "...",
     allocation_id: "...",
     receipt_hash: "...",
     ledger_hash: null,
     amount_settled: 950_000,
     platform_fee: 50_000,
     platform_fee_rate: 0.05,
     status: "completed",
     settled_at: Date.now(),
  +  issuer_relay_id: "<relay motebit_id>",
  +  suite: "motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1",
  +  signature: "<base64url Ed25519 over canonical body minus signature>",
   };
  ```

  Use `signSettlement(unsignedRecord, issuerPrivateKey)` from
  `@motebit/crypto` (or `@motebit/encryption`) to produce a valid
  signed record from the body fields:

  ```ts
  import { signSettlement } from "@motebit/encryption";

  const signed = await signSettlement(
    {
      settlement_id,
      allocation_id,
      receipt_hash,
      ledger_hash,
      amount_settled,
      platform_fee,
      platform_fee_rate,
      status,
      settled_at,
      issuer_relay_id,
    },
    relayPrivateKey,
  );
  // signed.suite + signed.signature are now set
  ```

  Verifiers use `verifySettlement(record, issuerPublicKey)` —
  returns `true` only if the signature matches the canonical body
  under the embedded suite.

  `@motebit/api` (services/api) is NOT updated by this commit. The
  SettlementRecord-shaped output the relay produces today will fail
  the new wire schema validation until the relay integration commit
  (C) lands. That commit adds the `signature` column to
  `relay_settlements`, signs at INSERT time, and emits the signed
  shape on the audit-facing endpoints. The protocol-layer ships
  first so the contract is unambiguous before consumer code is
  modified.

  Drift defense #22 (zod ↔ TS ↔ JSON) and #23 (spec ↔ schema) both
  green after `api:extract` baseline refresh.

- db5af58: Add `ToolInvocationReceipt` — a per-tool-call signed artifact that
  complements `ExecutionReceipt`. Where the task receipt commits to the
  turn as a whole, the tool-invocation receipt commits to each individual
  tool call inside the turn, letting the agent-workstation surface show
  (and a third party verify) exactly which tool ran, with what argument
  shape, and what it returned — one signature per call.

  Why a sibling artifact instead of a nested field:
  - Third-party verifiers checking a single tool's output do not need the
    enclosing task's receipt — the per-call receipt is independently
    self-verifiable with just the signer's public key.
  - The workstation surface emits these live as tool calls complete,
    before the enclosing task finishes; nesting inside `ExecutionReceipt`
    would force the UI to wait for the outer receipt.
  - Delegation is already recursive at the task level
    (`delegation_receipts`); keeping tool-invocation receipts separate
    avoids tangling two different recursion shapes in one artifact.

  Commits to structural facts only: tool name, JCS-canonical SHA-256
  hashes of the args and the result, the terminal status, the motebit +
  device identities, and timestamps. The raw args and raw result bytes
  are _not_ part of the receipt; a verifier who holds them can recompute
  the hash and check it against the signature.

  New exports — `@motebit/protocol`:
  - `ToolInvocationReceipt` interface.

  New exports — `@motebit/crypto`:
  - `SignableToolInvocationReceipt` interface (structurally compatible
    with the protocol type; matches the existing `SignableReceipt`
    pattern).
  - `TOOL_INVOCATION_RECEIPT_SUITE` constant.
  - `signToolInvocationReceipt` — JCS canonicalize, dispatch through
    `signBySuite`, base64url-encode. Freezes the returned receipt.
  - `verifyToolInvocationReceipt` — fails closed on unknown suite, bad
    base64, or signature mismatch; same rules as `verifyExecutionReceipt`.
  - `hashToolPayload` — canonical SHA-256 helper for args/result hashing.

  Tests: 12 new cases in `verify-artifacts.test.ts` covering round-trip,
  tamper detection on `tool_name` / `result_hash` / `invocation_origin`,
  wrong-key rejection, determinism, public-key embedding, fail-closed
  suite check, and `hashToolPayload` canonicalization invariance.

  This commit lands only the primitive. Emission (extending the
  `tool_status` chunk in `@motebit/ai-core` with args + tool_call_id and
  composing/signing the receipt in `@motebit/runtime`'s streaming
  manager) follows in a separate change. No runtime behavior changes
  yet — adding a new signed artifact to the toolbox.

  Part of the agent-workstation surface work: receipts are the
  motebit-unique layer underneath any execution mode. The workstation
  panel subscribes to these as they land.

### Patch Changes

- bce38b7: Complete the four-field-contract classification pass on every remaining
  `@deprecated` annotation in motebit's source: 14 markers across
  `@motebit/ai-core`, `@motebit/market`, `@motebit/mcp-client`,
  `services/api`, `apps/web`, and `apps/cli` now name `since`,
  `removed in`, replacement, and reason — matching the contract codified
  in `docs/doctrine/deprecation-lifecycle.md`.

  Two small takes-own-medicine fixes landed with the pass:
  `apps/desktop` dropped its re-export of the deprecated
  `OllamaDetectionResult` alias, and `services/api`'s federation-e2e
  tests migrated from the deprecated `PeerRateLimiter` alias to
  `FixedWindowLimiter` directly. The `authToken` field on
  `McpClientConfig` keeps its internal callers intentionally — the
  `StaticCredentialSource` wrapper is the documented deprecation-window
  bridge, matching the doctrine's "wrap + warn + strip at named sunset"
  pattern.

  No runtime behavior change. The post-1.0 `check-deprecation-discipline`
  drift gate (named in the doctrine) will scan a uniform shape across
  the entire codebase with no grandfathered exceptions.

- 9dc5421: Internal hygiene: migrate motebit's own callers off the `verifyIdentityFile`
  legacy shim (`@motebit/crypto`). Every `create-motebit` and `motebit` call
  site now uses the unified `verify()` dispatcher, so the fixed-group 1.0
  publish no longer ships code that consumes its own `@deprecated` API.

  The `verifyIdentityFile` and `LegacyVerifyResult` exports remain published
  from `@motebit/crypto` for external pre-0.4.0 consumers through the
  deprecation window, with their `@deprecated` annotations rewritten to the
  four-field contract (`since 1.0.0, removed in 2.0.0, Use verify(content)
instead, …reason`) required by `docs/doctrine/deprecation-lifecycle.md`.

- d969e7c: Ship `@motebit/crypto-appattest` — the Apple App Attest chain verifier. Verifies a `HardwareAttestationClaim` with `platform: "device_check"` by decoding Apple's CBOR attestation object, chain-verifying the leaf + intermediate against the pinned Apple App Attestation Root CA, checking the `1.2.840.113635.100.8.2` nonce-binding extension against `SHA256(authData || clientDataHash)`, and asserting `authData.rpIdHash === SHA256(bundleId)`. Apache-2.0 Layer 2 permissive-floor leaf — metabolizes `@peculiar/x509` + `cbor2` while `@motebit/crypto` stays permissive-floor-pure.

  `@motebit/crypto::verifyHardwareAttestationClaim` now accepts an optional `HardwareAttestationVerifiers` record; consumers wire `deviceCheckVerifier(...)` from `@motebit/crypto-appattest` into `verify(cred, { hardwareAttestation: { deviceCheck } })` to enable App Attest verification. Unwired platforms fail-closed with a named-missing-adapter error. The dispatcher's return type is now `HardwareAttestationVerifyResult | Promise<HardwareAttestationVerifyResult>` — the SE path remains synchronous; injected adapters may return a Promise.

  Mobile mint path now cascades App Attest → Secure Enclave → software via the new `expo-app-attest` native module (iOS `DCAppAttestService`, Android stub). The canonical composer `composeHardwareAttestationCredential` and the drift gates stay unchanged — every surface still delegates VC envelope + eddsa-jcs-2022 signing to the single source of truth.

- 1e07df5: Ship `@motebit/verifier` — offline third-party verifier for every signed Motebit artifact (identity files, execution receipts, W3C verifiable credentials, presentations). Exposes `verifyFile` / `verifyArtifact` / `formatHuman` as a library and the `motebit-verify` CLI with POSIX exit codes (0 valid · 1 invalid · 2 usage/IO). Zero network, zero deps beyond `@motebit/crypto`. Joins the fixed public-surface version group.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- b231e9c: MIT/BSL protocol boundary, credential anchoring, unified Solana anchoring
  - **@motebit/crypto** — new package (replaces @motebit/verify). First npm publish. Sign and verify all artifacts with zero runtime deps. New: `computeCredentialLeaf`, `verifyCredentialAnchor` (4-step self-verification).
  - **@motebit/protocol** — new types: `CredentialAnchorBatch`, `CredentialAnchorProof`, `ChainAnchorSubmitter`, `CredentialChainAnchor`. Semiring algebra moved to MIT.
  - **@motebit/sdk** — re-exports new protocol types.
  - **create-motebit** — no API changes.
  - **motebit** — sovereign delegation (`--sovereign` flag), credential anchoring admin panel, unified Solana anchoring for settlement + credential streams.

  New specs: settlement@1.0, auth-token@1.0, credential-anchor@1.0, delegation@1.0 (4 new, 9 total).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 9b6a317: Move trust algebra from MIT sdk to BSL semiring — enforce IP boundary.

  **Breaking:** The following exports have been removed from `@motebit/sdk`:
  - `trustLevelToScore`, `trustAdd`, `trustMultiply`, `composeTrustChain`, `joinParallelRoutes`
  - `evaluateTrustTransition`, `composeDelegationTrust`
  - `TRUST_LEVEL_SCORES`, `DEFAULT_TRUST_THRESHOLDS`, `TRUST_ZERO`, `TRUST_ONE`

  These are trust algebra algorithms that belong in the BSL-licensed runtime, not the MIT-licensed type vocabulary. Type definitions (`TrustTransitionThresholds`, `DelegationReceiptLike`, `AgentTrustLevel`, `AgentTrustRecord`) remain in the SDK unchanged.

  Also adds CI enforcement (checks 9-10 in check-deps) preventing algorithm code from leaking into MIT packages in the future.

### Patch Changes

- Typed relay errors, storage parity, deletion policy, dead code cleanup.
  - Wire `SettlementError` and `FederationError` into relay paths (previously generic `Error`)
  - Pluggable logger in sync-engine encrypted adapter (replaces `console.warn`)
  - Scope knip to external deps (`@motebit/*` excluded from dead-code analysis)
  - Remove dead `@noble/ciphers` (Web Crypto API replaced it)
  - Remove dead code: `termWidth`, web error banner cluster (JS + CSS + HTML)
  - Encode deletion policy as architectural invariant in CLAUDE.md
  - Full storage parity: all surfaces wire complete `StorageAdapters` interface
  - Mark `verifyIdentityFile()` as deprecated in verify README
  - Override `@xmldom/xmldom` to >=0.8.12 (GHSA-wh4c-j3r5-mjhp)

  - Memory system: calibrated tagging prompt, consolidation dedup (REINFORCE no longer creates nodes), self-referential filter, valid_until display filtering across all surfaces
  - Empty-response guard: re-prompt when tag stripping yields no visible text after tool calls
  - Governor fix: candidate modifications (confidence cap, sensitivity reclassification) now respected in turn loop

All notable changes to `@motebit/crypto` are documented here. For full project history, see the [root changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Polymorphic `verify(artifact, options?)` — verifies any Motebit artifact: identity files, execution receipts, verifiable credentials, and verifiable presentations
- Discriminated union result types: `IdentityVerifyResult`, `ReceiptVerifyResult`, `CredentialVerifyResult`, `PresentationVerifyResult`
- Optional `expectedType` for fail-fast type checking
- Execution receipt verification: Ed25519 signature over canonical JSON, recursive delegation chain verification, embedded public key support
- Verifiable credential verification: eddsa-jcs-2022 Data Integrity proof, expiry checking
- Verifiable presentation verification: envelope proof + each contained credential verified independently
- `verifyIdentityFile()` legacy function for backward compatibility

### Changed

- `verify()` now accepts any artifact type (string or object), not just identity file strings
- Identity results include both `.error` (string, backward compat) and `.errors` (array, new)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- `did` field in `VerifyResult` — every verified identity now includes its W3C `did:key` Decentralized Identifier
- Bundle directory verification: validates identity + credentials + presentations as a unit

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- Published to npm with provenance

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- Ed25519 signature verification for `motebit.md` identity files
- `verifyIdentityFile(content)` — parse, validate, and verify signed agent identities
- MIT licensed, zero monorepo dependencies
