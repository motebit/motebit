/**
 * Cross-implementation conformance for the evidence-provenance byte-determinism
 * guardrail — the make-or-break of the whole arc (docs/doctrine/evidence-provenance.md
 * guardrail 3): a projection recipe is only a real PUBLIC protocol artifact if an
 * independent implementer, working from its SPEC alone, reproduces its fixture
 * byte-for-byte. If two correct implementations can diverge, a span located by one
 * is not confirmable by another and verifiable-locality dies.
 *
 * The recipe under test is `agency.html-text.v1`, published by agency.computer as a
 * frozen, world-public, citable spec (the consumer-forces-shape half of the co-design):
 *
 *   repo:    github.com/agency-computer/html-text-spec  (PUBLIC — raw URLs 200 unauth)
 *   commit:  01b475be38276621aab553d1aed7e6f02d80a64b  (pinned — v1 is immutable, §5)
 *   spec:    agency-html-text-v1.md                     (the AUTHORITY)
 *   fixture: agency-html-text-v1.json
 *            → vendored verbatim at ./fixtures/agency-html-text-v1.json
 *              (sha256 1e36c0223c57cf85b4f50a7b1bbf7b2bf664178bbaa9d43edcf81ab5337214d8 —
 *               byte-identical to the public source at the pinned commit; re-fetchable)
 *
 * BOUNDARY (load-bearing): motebit owns the SHAPE + the re-check LAW, NEVER the
 * projection recipe (document-format authority stays with the consumer). The
 * implementation below is NOT a motebit capability and is NEVER imported by the
 * shipped `verifyEvidenceProvenance` (which is domain-blind — it injects the
 * resolver). It exists ONLY here, as motebit acting as the INDEPENDENT second
 * implementer the guardrail requires: written from §2 of the spec ALONE (their
 * reference `reference/projection.ts` was deliberately NOT read), to prove the recipe is
 * byte-deterministic. A divergence would be a spec/impl defect to report upstream,
 * never a tolerance to widen.
