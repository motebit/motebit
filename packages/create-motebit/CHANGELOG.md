# create-motebit Changelog

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 98bea3e: Fix test assertion that coupled create-motebit's own version to the
  `@motebit/crypto` version pinned in scaffold output. The pre-fix
  release.yml run failed at `Test published packages`:

  ```text
  AssertionError: expected '^1.1.0' to be '^1.1.1'
    Expected: "^1.1.1"
    Received: "^1.1.0"
  ```

  The assertion `expect(pkg.dependencies["@motebit/crypto"]).toBe(\`^${VERSION}\`)`asserted the scaffolded crypto pin equals create-motebit's own`PKG.version`. That coupling held by accident before the fix in the
prior commit because the misnamed `**VERIFY_VERSION**` constant made
  all three pinned versions identical to crypto's. After the fix, each
  package pins its actual published version (crypto 1.1.0, sdk 1.0.1,
  motebit 1.0.1, create-motebit's own version independent).

  Test now reads `@motebit/crypto`'s package.json directly and asserts
  the scaffold pins `^${CRYPTO_VERSION}` — same source of truth tsup uses
  to inject `__CRYPTO_VERSION__` at build time. Decouples the test from
  the coincidence.

  48/48 create-motebit tests pass.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 7268650: Fix scaffold-emitted version pins for `@motebit/sdk` and `motebit`. The
  1.1.0 release shipped a misconfigured tsup constant: `__VERIFY_VERSION__`
  was misnamed (the variable read `@motebit/crypto`'s version, not
  `@motebit/verify`'s) and was reused for three packages on different
  release cadences. After the 2026-04-27 release: `@motebit/crypto` minor
  to 1.1.0, `@motebit/sdk` patch to 1.0.1, `motebit` patch to 1.0.1 — but
  the scaffold emitted `^1.1.0` for all three. `npm install` failed with
  `ETARGET No matching version found for @motebit/sdk@^1.1.0` — the
  post-publish smoke test caught this immediately.

  Replaces the single misnamed `__VERIFY_VERSION__` constant with three
  correctly-named per-package constants (`__CRYPTO_VERSION__`,
  `__SDK_VERSION__`, `__MOTEBIT_VERSION__`) read from each package's
  `package.json` at tsup-build time. Each scaffold-emitted dep now pins
  the actual published version of the package it names.

  Verified: `node create-motebit dist/index.js test-agent --agent --yes`
  produces `package.json` with `@motebit/sdk: ^1.0.1` and
  `motebit: ^1.0.1` (matching what shipped). `npm install` in the
  scaffolded project resolves cleanly.

  Adds `@motebit/sdk` and `motebit` to create-motebit's devDependencies
  (`workspace:*`) so the tsup build can `require.resolve` them
  deterministically across pnpm workspace hoisting variations.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- eb843d3: `create-motebit --agent` scaffold is now actually runnable.

  The published `--agent` path was structurally broken in two independent ways, both at 100% reproduction rate, both silent because release.yml's smoke test only exercised the default (identity-only) scaffold. Found in the 2026-04-25 first-time-user walkthrough of the agent path.

  What was broken:
  1. **`npm run build` failed immediately** with three TypeScript errors: `Cannot find module 'node:fs'`, `'node:path'`, `'node:child_process'`. The agent scaffold's `src/index.ts` imports Node built-ins, but the scaffold's `package.json` did not include `@types/node` in `devDependencies` and the `tsconfig.json` had no `types` array — so TypeScript couldn't resolve the type declarations and bailed before ever producing `dist/`.
  2. **The entrypoint recursively spawned `motebit serve` forever.** `motebit serve --tools <path>` re-imports the agent's compiled entrypoint to discover tool definitions. Without a main-module guard, that re-import re-executed the spawn block at module top level, spawning another `motebit serve`, which re-imported, spawning another, recursive. 12 spawns in 8 seconds before manual kill. The agent never registered with the relay, never accepted a task, never did anything.

  What changed:
  - Added `@types/node ^22.0.0` to the agent scaffold's `devDependencies`. Build now compiles cleanly on a fresh checkout.
  - Added a main-module guard to the rendered `src/index.ts` using `process.argv[1] === fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)`. The spawn block now fires only when the file is executed directly (`npm run dev`, `node dist/index.js`); re-importing the file as a tool source returns the default export without side effects.
  - Updated the agent scaffold's `package.json` `verify` script to use `npx -p @motebit/verify motebit-verify motebit.md`, matching the next-steps fix already shipped for the default scaffold.
  - Three new regression tests in `index.test.ts` assert: `@types/node` is in devDependencies, the entrypoint contains the main-module guard pattern with `execFileSync` inside the guard block, and the `verify` script uses the canonical `@motebit/verify` invocation.
  - Extended `.github/workflows/release.yml`'s post-publish smoke to also exercise the `--agent` path: scaffolds, installs, builds, and imports `dist/index.js` as a module (the import would hang or fail without the main-module guard). The default-scaffold smoke remains as the first stage. Both stages run with isolated `MOTEBIT_CONFIG_DIR`s so the smoke can never affect a real motebit identity.

  Migration: none. Existing agents already running locally are unaffected (they presumably have `@types/node` installed). The fix is purely scaffold-side.

- 85fb31f: `create-motebit` refuses to clobber an existing identity in `--yes` mode without explicit `--force`.

  Previously, `npx create-motebit my-agent --yes` silently overwrote the top-level fields of `~/.motebit/config.json` (`motebit_id`, `device_id`, `device_public_key`, `cli_encrypted_key`) if a motebit identity already existed there. The interactive path prompts about this; the non-interactive path did not. Discovered as gap #2 of the 2026-04-25 first-time-user walkthrough — running the CI-style smoke on a developer machine clobbered the user's real identity.

  What changed:
  - `--yes` mode now calls `assertNoExistingIdentity()` before generating; if `motebit_id` is populated in the resolved config (`MOTEBIT_CONFIG_DIR` or `~/.motebit/`), it errors with a message naming both escape hatches.
  - New `--force` flag for explicit replacement.
  - Error message points at `MOTEBIT_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/foo` for isolated smoke runs and `--force` for intentional re-scaffolding.
  - The gate applies to both the default scaffold and `--agent` mode.
  - Interactive mode is unchanged — it already prompts the user about existing identities and that path was correct.

  Three new regression tests in `index.test.ts` assert: the gate fires and the existing config file is unchanged byte-for-byte; `--force` overrides and merges the new identity over preserved non-identity fields; `--agent --yes` also enforces the gate.

  Migration: automation that relied on `--yes` silently overwriting must add `--force`. CI smokes that run in fresh containers (no pre-existing config) are unaffected — release.yml's smoke test path is one such consumer and continues to work without changes.

  Also: the scaffold's "Next steps" output now points users at `npx -p @motebit/verify motebit-verify motebit.md` (gap #4 from the same walkthrough — the unscoped `npx motebit-verify` returns 404 because the package is published as `@motebit/verify`).

### Patch Changes

- 16e450b: `create-motebit` scaffold polish — READMEs, prestart safety, agent verify next-step.

  **Bump level**: patch. Each item here is a repair (the `npm start` clean-checkout failure, the agent next-steps inconsistency, the default-scaffold's verify-script invocation pointing at a non-canonical path) plus the README addition which the doctrine explicitly classifies as patch-shaped ("doc, comment, README, or test changes"). The package's eventual published version still becomes `create-motebit@1.1.0` — the `--force` changeset shipped earlier in the same release train is the load-bearing minor; this changeset rides that bump without manufacturing a second one.

  Three smaller gaps from the 2026-04-25 first-time-user walkthroughs (default + agent paths) batched into one polish pass:

  **Gap #5 / #A5 — both scaffolds now write a `README.md`.** The "Next steps" output only existed on stdout; closing the terminal lost the instructions. The README is the durable record. Includes the canonical verify commands, the directory contents, the relay-auth model, and pointers to docs + the-stack-one-layer-up doctrine.

  **Gap #A6 — agent scaffold's `package.json` adds a `prestart: "tsc"` hook.** Running `npm start` on a clean checkout used to bail with `Cannot find module dist/index.js`. The prestart hook makes `npm start` build first automatically — npm's canonical pattern for "build before start." `start` itself stays a single-line `node dist/index.js` invocation suitable for production runners that pre-build separately.

  **Gap #A7 — agent scaffold's "Next steps" output adds a `npm run verify` line.** Default scaffold included this; agent scaffold dropped it. New users had no canonical pointer to verify the agent's `motebit.md` signature before putting it on the network. Now both paths are consistent.

  **Default scaffold's `verify` script** also updated to use `npx -p @motebit/verify motebit-verify motebit.md` (matching the agent scaffold and the next-steps output already updated in the previous commit). Replaces the previous `npx create-motebit verify motebit.md` — both work, but the canonical CLI invocation is what users see in next-steps and READMEs everywhere else.

  Three new regression tests:
  - `default scaffold writes a README documenting verify commands and motebit_id`
  - `agent scaffold writes a README and includes prestart for npm start safety`
  - `agent scaffold's next-steps output includes a verify step`

  48/48 create-motebit tests pass. End-to-end verified locally: scaffold, install, build, verify, run all clean.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 009f56e: Add cryptosuite discriminator to every signed wire-format artifact.

  `@motebit/protocol` now exports `SuiteId`, `SuiteEntry`, `SuiteStatus`,
  `SuiteAlgorithm`, `SuiteCanonicalization`, `SuiteSignatureEncoding`,
  `SuitePublicKeyEncoding`, `SUITE_REGISTRY`, `ALL_SUITE_IDS`, `isSuiteId`,
  `getSuiteEntry`. Every signed artifact type gains a required `suite:
SuiteId` field alongside `signature`. Four Ed25519 suites enumerated
  (`motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1`, `motebit-jcs-ed25519-hex-v1`,
  `motebit-jwt-ed25519-v1`, `motebit-concat-ed25519-hex-v1`) plus the
  existing W3C `eddsa-jcs-2022` for Verifiable Credentials.

  Verifiers reject missing or unknown `suite` values fail-closed. No
  legacy compatibility path. Signers emit `suite` on every new artifact.

  Identity file signature format changed:
  - Old: `<!-- motebit:sig:Ed25519:{hex} -->`
  - New: `<!-- motebit:sig:motebit-jcs-ed25519-hex-v1:{hex} -->`

  The `identity.algorithm` frontmatter field is deprecated (ignored with
  a warning when present; no longer emitted on export).

  Post-quantum migration becomes a new `SuiteId` entry + dispatch arm in
  `@motebit/crypto/suite-dispatch.ts`, not a wire-format change.

  ## Migration

  This release is breaking for every consumer that constructs, signs, or verifies a motebit signed artifact. The change is mechanical — add one field on construction, pass one argument on sign, re-sign identity files once — but there is no legacy acceptance path, so every caller must update in lockstep. Verifiers reject unsuited or unknown-suite artifacts fail-closed. Migration steps follow, grouped by the consumer surface.

  ### For consumers of `@motebit/protocol` types

  Every signed-artifact type now has a required `suite: SuiteId` field.
  Anywhere you construct one (tests, mocks, fixtures), add the correct
  suite value for that artifact class — see `SUITE_REGISTRY`'s
  `description` field for the per-artifact assignment, or consult
  `spec/<artifact>-v1.md §N.N` for the binding wire format.

  ```ts
  // Before
  const receipt: ExecutionReceipt = {
    task_id, motebit_id, ...,
    signature: sigHex,
  };

  // After
  import type { SuiteId } from "@motebit/protocol";
  const receipt: ExecutionReceipt = {
    task_id, motebit_id, ...,
    suite: "motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1" satisfies SuiteId,
    signature: sigHex,
  };
  ```

  ### For consumers of `@motebit/crypto` sign/verify helpers

  Sign helpers that previously accepted just keys now require a `suite`
  parameter constrained to the suites valid for the artifact class:

  ```ts
  // Before
  const receipt = await signExecutionReceipt(body, privateKey);

  // After
  const receipt = await signExecutionReceipt(body, privateKey, {
    suite: "motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1",
  });
  ```

  Verify helpers route through the internal `verifyBySuite` dispatcher;
  direct calls are unchanged at the boundary, but behavior now rejects
  artifacts without a `suite` field (legacy-no-suite path is deleted).

  ### For consumers of `motebit.md` identity files

  Identity files signed before this release will fail to parse. Re-sign
  by running `motebit export --regenerate` (or the CLI equivalent) after
  upgrading. The `identity.algorithm` YAML field is ignored on new
  parses and no longer emitted on export.

  ### For consumers of `DelegationToken` (`@motebit/crypto`)

  `DelegationToken` carries two breaking changes beyond the suite addition.
  Public keys are now **hex-encoded** (64 chars, lowercase) instead of
  base64url — consistent with every other Ed25519-key-carrying motebit
  artifact. And `signDelegation` takes `Omit<DelegationToken, "signature"
| "suite">` (the signer stamps the suite).

  ```ts
  // Before
  const token = await signDelegation(
    {
      delegator_id,
      delegator_public_key: toBase64Url(kp.publicKey),
      delegate_id,
      delegate_public_key: toBase64Url(otherKp.publicKey),
      scope,
      issued_at,
      expires_at,
    },
    kp.privateKey,
  );

  // After
  const token = await signDelegation(
    {
      delegator_id,
      delegator_public_key: bytesToHex(kp.publicKey),
      delegate_id,
      delegate_public_key: bytesToHex(otherKp.publicKey),
      scope,
      issued_at,
      expires_at,
    },
    kp.privateKey,
  );
  // token.suite is stamped as "motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1"
  ```

  Verifiers reject tokens without `suite` (or with any value other than
  `"motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1"`) fail-closed, and decode `delegator_public_key`
  from hex. Base64url-encoded tokens issued before this release do not
  verify — pre-launch, no migration tool is provided; re-issue tokens
  after upgrading.

  ### Running the new drift gates locally

  `pnpm run check` now runs ten drift gates (previously eight). Two new
  gates — `check-suite-declared` and `check-suite-dispatch` — enforce
  that every signed Wire-format spec section names a `suite` field and
  that every verifier in `@motebit/crypto` dispatches via the shared
  `verifyBySuite` function (no direct primitive calls).

- 2d8b91a: **Permissive floor flipped from MIT to Apache-2.0. Every contributor's work on the floor now carries an explicit, irrevocable patent grant and a patent-litigation-termination clause.**

  The `@motebit/protocol`, `@motebit/sdk`, `@motebit/crypto`, `@motebit/verifier`, `create-motebit`, the four `@motebit/crypto-*` hardware-attestation platform leaves (Apple App Attest, Google Play Integrity, TPM 2.0, WebAuthn), and the `motebit-verify` GitHub Action — the permissive-floor packages — have moved from MIT to Apache-2.0 in a coordinated release. The `spec/` tree carries Apache-2.0 too; every committed JSON Schema artifact under `spec/schemas/*.json` carries `"$comment": "SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0"` as its first field.

  ## Why
  1. **Patent clarity across the floor.** The floor now includes four verifiers operating against vendor attestation chains in heavy patent territory — Apple, Google, Microsoft, Infineon, Nuvoton, STMicroelectronics, Intel, Yubico, the FIDO Alliance. The VC/DID space the protocol builds on also carries patent filings. Apache-2.0 §3 grants every contributor's patent license irrevocably; §4.2 terminates the license of anyone who litigates patent claims against the Work. MIT is silent on patents.
  2. **Convergence.** The BSL runtime converts to Apache-2.0 at the Change Date (four years after each version's first public release). With the floor at MIT, the end state was MIT floor + Apache-2.0 runtime — two licenses forever. With the floor at Apache-2.0, the end state is one license: one posture, one patent grant, one procurement decision. Motebit's meta-principle is "never let spec and code diverge"; a built-in two-license end state is exactly the drift the rest of the codebase is designed to prevent.
  3. **Enterprise and standards-track posture.** Identity infrastructure that serious operators bet on ships Apache-2.0: Kubernetes, Kafka, Envoy, Istio, OpenTelemetry, SPIFFE, Keycloak. The IETF and W3C working groups that may eventually carry motebit specs also ship reference implementations under Apache-2.0. The license is part of the signal that motebit is protocol infrastructure, not an npm utility library.

  ## What changed at npm
  - `@motebit/protocol` `license` field: `"MIT"` → `"Apache-2.0"`.
  - `@motebit/sdk` `license` field: `"MIT"` → `"Apache-2.0"`.
  - `@motebit/crypto` `license` field: `"MIT"` → `"Apache-2.0"`.
  - `@motebit/verifier` `license` field: `"MIT"` → `"Apache-2.0"`.
  - `create-motebit` `license` field: `"MIT"` → `"Apache-2.0"`.
  - Each package's `LICENSE` file is replaced with the canonical Apache-2.0 text plus the existing trademark-reservation paragraph.
  - The `@motebit/crypto-appattest`, `@motebit/crypto-play-integrity`, `@motebit/crypto-tpm`, `@motebit/crypto-webauthn` leaves (currently private, bundled into `@motebit/verify`) also flip to Apache-2.0 at the source level.
  - A new `NOTICE` file at the repository root names the project, copyright holder, and trademark reservation per Apache §4.
  - The orphaned root `LICENSE-MIT` file is removed; the protocol badge and doctrine now point at `LICENSING.md` and the per-package `LICENSE` files.
  - `spec/` LICENSE is rewritten to Apache-2.0; the 52 committed JSON Schema artifacts under `spec/schemas/*.json` carry the `Apache-2.0` SPDX stamp.

  ## Migration

  For downstream consumers of the floor packages: **no code change required**. Apache-2.0 is strictly broader than MIT — everything permitted under MIT remains permitted under Apache-2.0. The `license` field in the npm manifest changes value, the installed `LICENSE` text changes shape, and the published `NOTICE` file appears, but nothing about importing or calling these packages changes.

  ```diff
    // Before — consumer's package.json
    "dependencies": {
  -   "@motebit/protocol": "^0.8.0"   // MIT
  +   "@motebit/protocol": "^1.0.0"   // Apache-2.0
    }
  ```

  ```ts
  // Before and after — no code change; same imports, same behavior
  import type { ExecutionReceipt } from "@motebit/protocol";
  import { verify, signExecutionReceipt } from "@motebit/crypto";
  ```

  For downstream contributors: the contributions you submit to the permissive floor now carry an explicit Apache §3 patent grant and are covered by the §4.2 litigation-termination clause. Inbound = outbound: what you grant to the project is what the project grants to users. The signed CLA (`CLA.md`) is updated in the same commit to reflect the new license instance. No re-signing is required for contributors who have already signed; the inbound-equals-outbound principle does the right thing automatically.

  For operators: the root `LICENSE` BSL text is unchanged. The embedded "Apache-2.0-Licensed Components" section lists the ten permissive-floor packages and `spec/`. A new `NOTICE` file at the repo root carries the Apache §4 attribution. The orphan `LICENSE-MIT` file at the repo root is removed.

  ## Backwards compatibility

  Apache-2.0 is broader than MIT — everything permitted under MIT remains permitted under Apache-2.0. Existing consumers of the floor packages do not need to change anything to continue use. The new additions are the patent grant (you, as a contributor, pass one) and the termination clause (you, as a contributor, lose your license if you sue over patents).

  ## Naming

  Identifier-level code (`PERMISSIVE_PACKAGES`, `PERMISSIVE_IMPORT_ALLOWED`, `PERMISSIVE_ALLOWED_FUNCTIONS`, the `check-spec-permissive-boundary` CI gate, the `permissive-client-only-e2e.test.ts` adversarial test) uses the architectural role name — "permissive floor" — not the specific license instance. Same pattern the codebase already uses for cryptosuite agility (one `SuiteId` registry; specific instances like `motebit-jcs-ed25519-b64-v1` are replaceable). Doctrine prose names `Apache-2.0` concretely where instance-level precision matters.

- e17bf47: Publish the four hardware-attestation platform verifier leaves as first-class
  Apache-2.0 packages, joining the fixed-group release at 1.0.0.

  Stop-ship finding from the 1.0 pre-publish audit: `@motebit/verify@1.0.0`
  declared runtime dependencies on four `@motebit/crypto-*` adapters marked
  `"private": true`, which would have caused `npm install @motebit/verify` to
  404 on the adapters. The root `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `LICENSING.md`, and the
  hardware-attestation doctrine all claim these adapters as public Apache-2.0
  permissive-floor packages — the `"private": true` markers were doctrine drift
  left behind from scaffolding.

  This changeset closes the drift by publishing the adapters and wiring them
  into the fixed group so they bump in lockstep with the rest of the protocol
  surface:
  - `@motebit/crypto-appattest` — Apple App Attest chain verifier (pinned
    Apple root)
  - `@motebit/crypto-play-integrity` — Google Play Integrity JWT verifier
    (pinned Google JWKS; structurally complete, fail-closed by default pending
    operator key wiring)
  - `@motebit/crypto-tpm` — TPM 2.0 Endorsement-Key chain verifier (pinned
    vendor roots)
  - `@motebit/crypto-webauthn` — WebAuthn packed-attestation verifier (pinned
    FIDO roots)

  Each carries the standard permissive-floor manifest (description, `exports`,
  `files`, `sideEffects: false`, `NOTICE`, keywords, homepage/repository/bugs,
  `publishConfig: public`, `lint:pack` with `publint` + `attw`, focused README
  showing how to wire the verifier into `@motebit/crypto`'s
  `HardwareAttestationVerifiers` dispatcher).

  Also in this changeset:
  - `engines.node` aligned to `>=20` across `@motebit/protocol`, `@motebit/sdk`,
    and `@motebit/crypto` — matches the rest of the fixed group and removes
    downstream consumer confusion (a `@motebit/verify` consumer on Node 18
    previously got inconsistent engines-check signals between libraries).
  - `NOTICE` added to `motebit` (the bundled CLI's tarball, required by Apache
    §4(d) because the bundle inlines Apache-licensed code from the permissive
    floor).

  No code changes — all four adapter implementations and public APIs are
  unchanged. The flip is manifest + metadata + README + fixed-group wiring.

  ## Migration

  **For `@motebit/verify` consumers:** no action required. `npm install -g @motebit/verify@1.0.0` now correctly pulls the four platform adapter packages from npm instead of failing on unpublished `workspace:*` refs. Before this changeset, `npm install @motebit/verify@1.0.0` would have 404'd on `@motebit/crypto-appattest@1.0.0` et al.

  **For direct library consumers (new capability):** the four platform adapters can now be imported independently when a third party wants only one platform's verifier without pulling the full CLI. Wiring into `@motebit/crypto`'s dispatcher:

  ```ts
  // Before (1.0.0-rc and earlier — adapters not installable from npm):
  // only possible via @motebit/verify's bundled verifyFile():
  import { verifyFile } from "@motebit/verifier";
  import { buildHardwareVerifiers } from "@motebit/verify";
  const result = await verifyFile("cred.json", {
    hardwareAttestation: buildHardwareVerifiers(),
  });

  // After (1.0.0 — fine-grained composition):
  import { verify } from "@motebit/crypto";
  import { deviceCheckVerifier } from "@motebit/crypto-appattest";
  import { webauthnVerifier } from "@motebit/crypto-webauthn";

  const result = await verify(credential, {
    hardwareAttestation: {
      deviceCheck: deviceCheckVerifier({ expectedBundleId: "com.example.app" }),
      webauthn: webauthnVerifier({ expectedRpId: "example.com" }),
      // tpm / playIntegrity omitted — verifier returns `adapter-not-configured` for those platforms
    },
  });
  ```

  **For Node 18 consumers of `@motebit/protocol`, `@motebit/sdk`, or `@motebit/crypto`:** the `engines.node` field now declares `>=20` across the entire fixed group (previously drifted: protocol/sdk/crypto said `>=18`, other packages said `>=20`). npm does not hard-enforce `engines` by default, so installs continue to succeed — but teams running strict-engine linters should upgrade to Node 20 LTS. Node 18 entered maintenance-only status April 2025.

  **For third-party protocol implementers:** no wire-format changes. The four platform attestation wire formats (`AppAttestCbor`, Play Integrity JWT, `TPMS_ATTEST`, WebAuthn packed attestation) are unchanged — this changeset only publishes the reference TypeScript verifiers for each.

- 58c6d99: **@motebit/verify resurrected as the canonical CLI, three-package lineage locked in.**

  The entire published protocol surface bumps to 1.0.0 in a coordinated release. What changes at npm:
  - **`@motebit/verify@1.0.0`** — fresh lineage superseding the deprecated `0.7.0` zero-dep library. Ships the `motebit-verify` CLI binary with every hardware-attestation platform bundled (Apple App Attest, Google Play Integrity, TPM 2.0, WebAuthn) and motebit-canonical defaults pre-wired (bundle IDs, RP ID, integrity floor). Network-free, self-attesting. License: Apache-2.0 — the aggregator encodes no motebit-proprietary judgment (defaults are overridable flags, not trust scoring or economics), so it sits on the permissive floor alongside the underlying leaves. Runs `npm install -g @motebit/verify` to get the tool, no license friction in CI pipelines or enterprise audit tooling.
  - **`@motebit/verifier@1.0.0`** — library-only. The `motebit-verify` CLI that used to live here has moved to `@motebit/verify` (above). This package now ships only the Apache-2.0 helpers (`verifyFile`, `verifyArtifact`, `formatHuman`, `VerifyFileOptions` with the optional `hardwareAttestation` injection point). Third parties writing Apache-2.0-only TypeScript verifiers compose this with `@motebit/crypto` — and optionally any subset of the four Apache-2.0 `@motebit/crypto-*` platform leaves — without pulling BSL code.
  - **`@motebit/crypto@1.0.0`** — role unchanged; version bump marks 1.0 maturity of the primitive substrate. Apache-2.0 (upgraded from MIT in the same release; the floor flip gives every contributor's work an explicit patent grant and litigation-termination clause), zero monorepo deps.
  - **`@motebit/protocol@1.0.0`** — wire types + algebra. Apache-2.0 permissive floor. 1.0 signals the protocol surface is stable enough to implement against.
  - **`@motebit/sdk@1.0.0`** — stable developer-contract surface. 1.0 locks the provider-resolver / preset / config vocabulary for integrators.
  - **`create-motebit@1.0.0`** — scaffolder bumps to match.
  - **`motebit@1.0.0`** — operator console CLI bumps to match.

  The three-package lineage for verification tooling follows the pattern that survives decades — git / libgit2, cargo / tokio, npm / @npm/arborist:

  ```
  @motebit/verify                Apache-2.0  the CLI motebit-verify + motebit-canonical defaults over the bundled leaves
  @motebit/verifier              Apache-2.0  library: verifyFile, verifyArtifact, formatHuman
  @motebit/crypto                Apache-2.0  primitives: verify, sign, suite dispatch
  @motebit/crypto-appattest      Apache-2.0  Apple App Attest chain verifier (pinned Apple root)
  @motebit/crypto-play-integrity Apache-2.0  Google Play Integrity JWT verifier (pinned Google JWKS)
  @motebit/crypto-tpm            Apache-2.0  TPM 2.0 EK chain verifier (pinned vendor roots)
  @motebit/crypto-webauthn       Apache-2.0  WebAuthn packed-attestation verifier (pinned FIDO roots)
  ```

  All seven packages in the verification lineage ship Apache-2.0 — the full verification surface lives on the permissive floor. Each answers "how is this artifact verified?" against a published public trust anchor, the permissive side of the protocol-model boundary test. The BSL line holds at `motebit` (the operator console) and everything below it, where the actual reference-implementation judgment lives (daemon, MCP server, delegation routing, market integration, federation wiring). See the separate `permissive-floor-apache-2-0` and `verify-cli-apache-2-0` changesets for the rationale behind the floor licensing.

  ## Migration

  The 1.0 release is a coordinated major bump across the fixed release group. The APIs exported by `@motebit/protocol`, `@motebit/sdk`, `@motebit/crypto`, `create-motebit`, and `motebit` have NOT broken — this major marks endgame-pattern maturity, not a code-shape change. The actual behavioral shifts are confined to the verification-tooling lineage:

  **1. `@motebit/verifier` bin removed (breaking).**

  ```ts
  // Before — @motebit/verifier@0.8.x shipped a `motebit-verify` binary.
  // After  — @motebit/verifier@1.0.0 is library-only.
  // Install `@motebit/verify@^1.0.0` for the CLI:
  //   npm install -g @motebit/verify
  //   motebit-verify cred.json
  // The programmatic library surface is unchanged:
  import { verifyFile, formatHuman } from "@motebit/verifier"; // ← still works
  ```

  **2. `@motebit/verify@0.7.0` (deprecated library) → `@motebit/verify@1.0.0` (resurrected CLI).**

  | You were using (0.7.0)                               | Migrate to                                                                          |
  | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `verify()` function in TypeScript                    | `import { verify } from "@motebit/crypto"` — same shape, more features              |
  | `verifyFile` / `formatHuman` / programmatic wrappers | `import { verifyFile } from "@motebit/verifier"`                                    |
  | Running `motebit-verify` on the command line         | `npm install -g @motebit/verify` at `^1.0.0` — same command, full platform coverage |

  Users pinned to `"@motebit/verify": "^0.7.0"` stay on the deprecated 0.x line automatically — semver prevents auto-bumps to 1.0.0. The 0.x tarballs remain immutable on npm; archaeology is preserved.

  ## Rationale

  The entire published protocol surface hits 1.0 together as the endgame-pattern milestone. The three-package lineage for verification tooling (verify / verifier / crypto) follows the shape long-lived tool families use — git / libgit2, cargo / tokio, npm / @npm/arborist. The coordinated major signals that this is the architecture intended to hold long-term.

  **Operator follow-up — run immediately after `pnpm changeset publish` returns:**

  ```bash
  npm deprecate @motebit/verify@0.7.0 \
    "Superseded by @motebit/verify@1.x — the canonical CLI. For the library, see @motebit/crypto."
  ```

  The current deprecation message on `0.7.0` dates from the 2026-04-09 package rename and still claims "Same MIT license" — factually correct then, stale the moment 1.0.0 ships (the permissive floor is now Apache-2.0). The replacement message points at both migration paths — the CLI (`@motebit/verify@1.x`) and the library (`@motebit/crypto`) — and makes no license claim that can age. Running it immediately after publish keeps the stale-message window down to minutes, not days.

### Patch Changes

- bce38b7: Complete the four-field-contract classification pass on every remaining
  `@deprecated` annotation in motebit's source: 14 markers across
  `@motebit/ai-core`, `@motebit/market`, `@motebit/mcp-client`,
  `services/api`, `apps/web`, and `apps/cli` now name `since`,
  `removed in`, replacement, and reason — matching the contract codified
  in `docs/doctrine/deprecation-lifecycle.md`.

  Two small takes-own-medicine fixes landed with the pass:
  `apps/desktop` dropped its re-export of the deprecated
  `OllamaDetectionResult` alias, and `services/api`'s federation-e2e
  tests migrated from the deprecated `PeerRateLimiter` alias to
  `FixedWindowLimiter` directly. The `authToken` field on
  `McpClientConfig` keeps its internal callers intentionally — the
  `StaticCredentialSource` wrapper is the documented deprecation-window
  bridge, matching the doctrine's "wrap + warn + strip at named sunset"
  pattern.

  No runtime behavior change. The post-1.0 `check-deprecation-discipline`
  drift gate (named in the doctrine) will scan a uniform shape across
  the entire codebase with no grandfathered exceptions.

- 9dc5421: Internal hygiene: migrate motebit's own callers off the `verifyIdentityFile`
  legacy shim (`@motebit/crypto`). Every `create-motebit` and `motebit` call
  site now uses the unified `verify()` dispatcher, so the fixed-group 1.0
  publish no longer ships code that consumes its own `@deprecated` API.

  The `verifyIdentityFile` and `LegacyVerifyResult` exports remain published
  from `@motebit/crypto` for external pre-0.4.0 consumers through the
  deprecation window, with their `@deprecated` annotations rewritten to the
  four-field contract (`since 1.0.0, removed in 2.0.0, Use verify(content)
instead, …reason`) required by `docs/doctrine/deprecation-lifecycle.md`.

- 1e07df5: Ship `@motebit/verifier` — offline third-party verifier for every signed Motebit artifact (identity files, execution receipts, W3C verifiable credentials, presentations). Exposes `verifyFile` / `verifyArtifact` / `formatHuman` as a library and the `motebit-verify` CLI with POSIX exit codes (0 valid · 1 invalid · 2 usage/IO). Zero network, zero deps beyond `@motebit/crypto`. Joins the fixed public-surface version group.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- b231e9c: MIT/BSL protocol boundary, credential anchoring, unified Solana anchoring
  - **@motebit/crypto** — new package (replaces @motebit/verify). First npm publish. Sign and verify all artifacts with zero runtime deps. New: `computeCredentialLeaf`, `verifyCredentialAnchor` (4-step self-verification).
  - **@motebit/protocol** — new types: `CredentialAnchorBatch`, `CredentialAnchorProof`, `ChainAnchorSubmitter`, `CredentialChainAnchor`. Semiring algebra moved to MIT.
  - **@motebit/sdk** — re-exports new protocol types.
  - **create-motebit** — no API changes.
  - **motebit** — sovereign delegation (`--sovereign` flag), credential anchoring admin panel, unified Solana anchoring for settlement + credential streams.

  New specs: settlement@1.0, auth-token@1.0, credential-anchor@1.0, delegation@1.0 (4 new, 9 total).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 9b6a317: Move trust algebra from MIT sdk to BSL semiring — enforce IP boundary.

  **Breaking:** The following exports have been removed from `@motebit/sdk`:
  - `trustLevelToScore`, `trustAdd`, `trustMultiply`, `composeTrustChain`, `joinParallelRoutes`
  - `evaluateTrustTransition`, `composeDelegationTrust`
  - `TRUST_LEVEL_SCORES`, `DEFAULT_TRUST_THRESHOLDS`, `TRUST_ZERO`, `TRUST_ONE`

  These are trust algebra algorithms that belong in the BSL-licensed runtime, not the MIT-licensed type vocabulary. Type definitions (`TrustTransitionThresholds`, `DelegationReceiptLike`, `AgentTrustLevel`, `AgentTrustRecord`) remain in the SDK unchanged.

  Also adds CI enforcement (checks 9-10 in check-deps) preventing algorithm code from leaking into MIT packages in the future.

### Patch Changes

- Typed relay errors, storage parity, deletion policy, dead code cleanup.
  - Wire `SettlementError` and `FederationError` into relay paths (previously generic `Error`)
  - Pluggable logger in sync-engine encrypted adapter (replaces `console.warn`)
  - Scope knip to external deps (`@motebit/*` excluded from dead-code analysis)
  - Remove dead `@noble/ciphers` (Web Crypto API replaced it)
  - Remove dead code: `termWidth`, web error banner cluster (JS + CSS + HTML)
  - Encode deletion policy as architectural invariant in CLAUDE.md
  - Full storage parity: all surfaces wire complete `StorageAdapters` interface
  - Mark `verifyIdentityFile()` as deprecated in verify README
  - Override `@xmldom/xmldom` to >=0.8.12 (GHSA-wh4c-j3r5-mjhp)
