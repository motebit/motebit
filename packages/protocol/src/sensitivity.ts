/**
 * Sensitivity ladder algebra — pure math over the closed
 * `SensitivityLevel` enum.
 *
 * The ladder is interop law. Every motebit implementation must agree
 * on which tier dominates which, or the cross-implementation gate
 * isn't interoperable: device A persisting a turn at "secret" must
 * mean the same thing to device B's session-tier filter.
 *
 * Pure deterministic math over a closed enum — qualifies as a
 * permissive-floor primitive per `packages/protocol/CLAUDE.md` rule 1
 * ("deterministic math (semiring algebra, canonical JSON, hash
 * primitives)"). The functions don't decide policy; they compose
 * ordered values. Policy thresholds (e.g. "medical+ requires
 * sovereign provider") live at the call site so call sites express
 * intent at the right level.
 *
 * Graduation history: `rankSensitivity` had three local definitions
 * by 2026-05-07 (runtime/motebit-runtime.ts, runtime/conversation.ts,
 * ai-core/loop.ts) plus a fourth-shaped table (`LEVEL_RANK` +
 * `higherLevel` in policy-invariants/computer-sensitivity.ts). The
 * ai-core copy's JSDoc explicitly named graduation as the trigger:
 * "if a third reader appears, the helper graduates." Past trigger.
 *
 * Naming distinction:
 * - `rankSensitivity` — load-bearing primitive; ordinal int over the
 *   closed union. Comparable, hashable, monotonic.
 * - `maxSensitivity` — typed wrapper for the join-semilattice
 *   composition (`max(a, b)`). Identity element is `None`. Used at
 *   every egress write boundary that floors message tier at
 *   `max(default, effective)`.
 * - `sensitivityPermits` — typed wrapper for the read-side filter
 *   (`candidate <= upper`). Used at every egress READ boundary that
 *   excludes content tagged above the current effective tier.
 *
 * Not a semiring. There's only one operation (max-monoid / join-
 * semilattice). Calling it a semiring would be a category error.

//   5. drift gate (`check-sensitivity-canonical` per `scripts/`)
//
// Pre-this-block, `SensitivityLevel` was the only top-tier closed
// registry without the iteration + guard pair — the gap surfaced in
// the registry-gate-family audit on 2026-05-14 (post panels-registry
// arc). The enum is preserved for back-compat with the ~900
// pre-existing literal sites; this block adds the missing canonical
// tooling next to it without converting the enum.
