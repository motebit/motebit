/**
 * Credential anchor wire schemas — chain-anchored credential transparency.
 *
 * Two artifacts in this cluster:
 *
 *   1. `CredentialAnchorBatch` — a relay's signed Merkle root over
 *      a batch of issued credentials. Optionally references the
 *      onchain transaction that anchored the root.
 *
 *   2. `CredentialAnchorProof` — a self-verifiable Merkle inclusion
 *      proof for one credential within an anchored batch. Carries
 *      everything needed to verify the credential without trusting
 *      the relay: the batch signature + public key, the Merkle path,
 *      and (optionally) the chain reference.
 *
 * The cryptosuite here is `motebit-jcs-ed25519-hex-v1` — HEX signature
 * encoding (not base64url like execution receipts and delegation
 * tokens). That's deliberate: anchor proofs interact with chain
 * submissions where hex is the convention, and the suite registry
 * tracks the encoding-per-artifact mapping.
 *
 * Why publish these: chain anchoring is the primary mechanism by
 * which motebit's accumulated reputation becomes externally
 * verifiable without trusting any relay. A third-party auditor with
 * a credential, a proof, and chain access can prove the credential
 * was issued at the claimed time, was part of a batch the relay
 * signed, and that batch's Merkle root was committed onchain — no
 * relay contact required for any step. With these schemas, that
 * verification is mechanical for any language that can do JSON
 * Schema validation + Ed25519 + SHA-256.
 *
 * The nested `CredentialChainAnchor` (chain/network/tx_hash/
 * anchored_at) is structurally covered as a nested-only schema in
 * both top-level objects — it's not exported separately because it
 * has no independent wire identity, only meaning when carried inside
 * a Batch or a Proof.
 *
 * See spec/credential-anchor-v1.md.
