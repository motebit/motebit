/**
 * Meta-check runner — one command that runs every hard-fail drift defense.
 *
 * The monorepo's synchronization invariants are enforced by a collection of
 * small, focused check-* scripts (see CLAUDE.md § "Synchronization
 * invariants are the meta-principle"). Each one owns a specific invariant:
 *
 *   check-deps              — architectural layers, MIT purity, cycles
 *   check-specs             — spec ↔ implementation references
 *   check-service-primitives — services must not inline protocol plumbing
 *   check-app-primitives    — apps must not bypass the product vocabulary
 *   check-memory            — user-memory freshness (advisory, exit 0)
 *
 * Before this runner existed, CI invoked each check individually —
 * meaning a new check that was only added to package.json (but not to
 * ci.yml) would run locally but stay silent in PRs. That is the exact
 * drift shape the checks themselves are designed to prevent.
 *
 * This runner is the single source of truth for which defenses run.
 * CI calls `pnpm check` once; adding a new gate means appending an
 * entry here. Adversarially tested: if any gate fails, this process
 * exits non-zero with a summary of which one(s).
 *
 * Soft/advisory checks are intentionally excluded from this runner:
 *   check-unused (knip)              — soft signal, CI uses continue-on-error
 *   check-sibling-boundaries         — PR-diff scoped, runs separately
 *   check-secrets.sh                 — pre-commit hook, not a CI gate
 *
 * Each exclusion must be named in EXCLUDED_CHECKS below so this runner
 * can assert that every `check-*` script in root package.json is either
 * listed as a gate or explicitly excluded — closing the sibling-drift
 * gap in the drift-defense system itself.
